\section{Key components}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two-way communication socket: carries out all the transactions between the server and the clients, through a TCP port available.
    \item Server Daemon : Initiates a wait loop to accept responses from clients (IDEs), and if a request is received, it spawns a thread corresponding to the request type (hover, autocomplete).
    \item Client: IDEs as clients send request to the server through the two-way communication socket, receives back json encoded response, decodes it, and performs the operation that was requested for.
    \item Hovering Process Module: Upon being requested, it runs the hover module and returns json encoded response generated, to the client via communication socket.
    \item Autocomplete Processing Module: Receives a string whose possible list of suffixes are to be returned in json format through the communication socket, to the client.
    
    \item We used StandardML’s Socket library and an extension of SML known as ConcurrentML (CML) to implement concurrency and handle sockets.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sockets:}
	Sockets are basically the end points of any communication channel for sending and receiving messages. Each Socket is associated with a specific socket address. A stream socket provides a sequenced and unique flow of data. It notifies the sender whether or not the message was sent to the intended receiver, successfully. Binding is a process that is used for associating a socket with a socket address.
	\item \textbf{Concurrent ML (CML):}
CML or Concurrent ML is a high performing language used for concurrent programming, which is an extension of Standard ML language, and is built on top of SML/NJ. It consists of multiple threads, which use synchronous message passing on typed channels to communicate and synchronize. When a thread wants to communicate on a channel, it must rendezvous with another thread that wants to do a complementary communication on same channel.
\end{itemize}
